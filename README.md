# 🤖 Sarcastic AI Chatbot

Welcome to the most unnecessary yet absolutely essential chatbot you'll ever talk to. This isn't your average LLM — it's sarcastic, moody, and always ready to roast you with style.

Built using **Streamlit** and **Gemini AI**, this chatbot has multiple personalities — from a Delhi boy with too much attitude to a poetic Bihari baba with sarcasm in rhyme.
